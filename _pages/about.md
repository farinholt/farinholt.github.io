I am a computer security researcher at [UC San Diego](https://cse.ucsd.edu/) in the Systems & Networking ([Sysnet](https://www.sysnet.ucsd.edu/sysnet/)) and Security & Cryptography ([Cryptosec](https://cryptosec.ucsd.edu/)) research groups. 

I am a member of the Center for Evidence-based Security Research ([CESR](https://www.evidencebasedsecurity.org/index.html)), the Center for Networked Systems ([CNS](https://cns.ucsd.edu/)), and the Aviation Cyber Security Group ([Aerosec](https://aerosec.org/)).

I received my Ph.D. in Computer Science (Computer Engineering) from [UC San Diego](https://cse.ucsd.edu/). My research focused on understanding the ecosystem of manually-operated malware, culminating in my dissertation, [*Understanding the Remote Access Trojan malware ecosystem through the lens of the infamous DarkComet RAT*](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3vv544n5).

I received my M.S. in Computer Science from [UC San Diego](https://cse.ucsd.edu/). My research exam, [*The U.S. Electrical Power Grid as a Cyber-Physical System: Understanding Exposed Attack Surfaces*](/assets/pdf/Research_Exam.pdf), catalogues a number of hypothetical attacks on power grid infrastructure.

I received my B.S. in Computer Engineering at [Clemson University](https://www.clemson.edu/cecas/departments/ece/), where I was a member of the National Scholars Program ([NSP](https://www.clemson.edu/academics/programs/national-scholars/)). For my senior thesis, I worked on a project circumventing Internet censorship, [*Internet Freedom in West Africa: Technical Support for Journalists and Democracy Advocates*](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/5/227189-internet-freedom-in-west-africa/fulltext).
