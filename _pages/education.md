In 2019, I received my **Ph.D. in Computer Science (Computer Engineering)** from [UC San Diego](https://cse.ucsd.edu/). My research focused on understanding the ecosystem of manually-operated malware, culminating in my dissertation, [*Understanding the Remote Access Trojan malware ecosystem through the lens of the infamous DarkComet RAT*](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/3vv544n5).

In 2015, I received my **M.S. in Computer Science** from [UC San Diego](https://cse.ucsd.edu/). My research exam, [*The U.S. Electrical Power Grid as a Cyber-Physical System: Understanding Exposed Attack Surfaces*](/assets/pdf/Research_Exam.pdf), catalogues a number of hypothetical attacks on power grid infrastructure.

In 2013, I received my **B.S. in Computer Engineering** at [Clemson University](https://www.clemson.edu/cecas/departments/ece/), where I was a member of the National Scholars Program ([NSP](https://www.clemson.edu/academics/programs/national-scholars/)). For my senior thesis, I worked on a project circumventing Internet censorship, [*Internet Freedom in West Africa: Technical Support for Journalists and Democracy Advocates*](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/5/227189-internet-freedom-in-west-africa/fulltext).
