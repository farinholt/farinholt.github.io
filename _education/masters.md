I received my M.S. in Computer Science from UC San Diego in 2015. My thesis catalogues a number of hypothetical attacks on power grid infrastructure and proposes research directions towards fully understanding the risk posed to computerized critical infrastructure. It is titled **The U.S. Electrical Power Grid as a Cyber-Physical System: Understanding Exposed Attack Surfaces** [[Paper]](/assets/pdf/Research_Exam.pdf).
