In 2019, I completed my Ph.D. in Computer Science (Computer Engineering) at [UC San Diego](https://cse.ucsd.edu/). 

I was a computer security researcher in the Systems & Networking ([Sysnet](https://www.sysnet.ucsd.edu/sysnet/)) and Security & Cryptography ([Cryptosec](https://cryptosec.ucsd.edu/)) research groups, as well as a member of the Center for Evidence-based Security Research ([CESR](https://www.evidencebasedsecurity.org/index.html)), the Center for Networked Systems ([CNS](https://cns.ucsd.edu/)), and the Aviation Cyber Security Group ([Aerosec](https://aerosec.org/)).

My research with [CESR](https://www.evidencebasedsecurity.org/index.html) focused on understanding the ecosystem of manually-operated malware. My thesis, entitled **Understanding the Remote Access Trojan malware ecosystem through the lens of the infamous DarkComet RAT**, includes studies of remote access trojan (RAT) operators in high-fidelity honeypots and the deployment of sinkholes and scanners in order to detect and monitor command-and-control servers as well as infections.

My research with [Aerosec](https://aerosec.org/) focused on the development of the **Triton** testbed for avionics security research. We also examined vulnerabilities in consumer IoT devices meant to replicate electronic flight bags.
