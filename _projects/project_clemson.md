I earned my B.S. in Computer Engineering at [Clemson University](https://www.clemson.edu/cecas/departments/ece/) in 2013, where I worked with [Dr. Richard Brooks](http://www.clemson.edu/ces/departments/ece/faculty_staff/faculty/rbrooks.html) on Internet censorship circumvention technology for deployment by West African journalists and democracy advocates. This project was titled **Internet Freedom in West Africa: Technical Support for Journalists and Democracy Advocates** [[Web]](https://cacm.acm.org/magazines/2018/5/227189-internet-freedom-in-west-africa/fulltext) [[PDF]](/assets/pdf/p72-brooks.pdf) [[Video]](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V6rb7VRa3oc).

As a member of the National Scholars Program ([NSP](https://www.clemson.edu/academics/programs/national-scholars/)), I was advised by [Jamie Williams](http://www.linkedin.com/pub/jamie-williams/5b/996/386) - now Director of Scholarships at the Coca-Cola Scholars Foundation - and [Dr. Bill Lasser](https://www.clemson.edu/cbshs/faculty-staff/profiles/lasser), Director of Clemson's Calhoun Honors College.
